# Community Issue Tracking

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to Sanmill!

We have started to involve the most active members of the community in our issue tracking to better load-balance the work and allow for quicker feedback on new issues. The following are the guidelines and extra powers for our community trackers:

Check our ["inbox"](https://github.com/Calcitem/Sanmill/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue) for new issues and see if any can be helped with:

- If it needs more information, explain what is missing:
  - For native crashes ask them to follow [Native Crash Issues](https://github.com/Calcitem/Sanmill/wiki/Native-Crash-Issues).
  - For non-English/Chinese reports, ask them to describe the issue in English/Chinese and suggest a machine translator.
