Each player has 9 pieces differing in color. Alternatively both will place the pieces (on the intersection or corner points of the board), always trying to get already a "Mill" by proper placing (3 horizontal or vertical pieces one beside the other). The player, who is able to close a Mill, may take one of the opponent's pieces: "Mill closed" (Any piece may be taken, except those being in a closed Mill).

When all pieces had been placed, then moves will be made, alternatively, as mentioned above , always one piece up to the next intersection or cornet point. To inflict damage to the opponent without running the risk of losing a piece from an open mill at the opponent's next move, one should try to build a double-mill, i.e, a Mill, in which the same move which opens one Mill closed simultaneously another one.

If a player cannot move one of his pieces (is locked up), he has lost the game.

A player who has only 3 pieces left, may leap, in other words he may place his pieces on any desired point. However, if a player has only 2 pieces left, he has lost the game.
