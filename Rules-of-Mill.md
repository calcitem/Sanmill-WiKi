## Nine men's Morris

Each player has 9 pieces differing in color. Alternatively, both will place the pieces (on the intersection or corner points of the board), always trying to get already a "Mill" by proper placing (3 horizontal or vertical pieces one beside the other). The player, who can close a Mill, may take one of the opponent's pieces: "Mill closed" (Any piece may be taken, except those in a closed Mill).

When all pieces had been placed, then moves will be made. Alternatively, as mentioned above, always one piece up to the next intersection or cornet point. To inflict damage to the opponent without running the risk of losing a piece from an open mill at the opponent's next move, one should try to build a double-mill, i.e., a Mill, in which the same move which opens one Mill closed simultaneously another one.

If a player cannot move one of his pieces (is locked up), he has lost the game.

A player who has only 3 pieces left may leap. In other words, he may place his pieces on any desired point. However, if a player has only 2 pieces left, he has lost the game.

## Twelve men's Morris

Twelve Men's Morris is a traditional board game similar to Nine Men's Morris. It was most popular during the Middle Ages when it was played in courts across Europe. It is played on a board with 24 nodes joined by lines; each player has twelve pieces. The game proceeds in three phases:

Players alternately place one piece on a node in each move. If a player makes three in a row, he or she can capture one of the opponent's pieces.
Once all the pieces are placed, players take turns moving the pieces to adjacent nodes. Again, whenever a player forms three in a row, one of the opponent's pieces may be captured.
When one player is down to just three pieces, the remaining pieces may "fly" to anywhere on the board (not just adjacent nodes).
You win when you reduce your opponent to two pieces, or when he or she can't move.

Two possible boards exist.
One has three concentric squares marked with the mid-points of the adjacent sides of the the squares linked and also the adjacent corners linked. This is known as "small board Twelve Men's Morris".

The other board has four concentric squares marked, and similar to Nine Men's Morris, has only the mid-points of the adjacent sides of the the squares linked. This is known as "large board Twelve Men's Morris".
