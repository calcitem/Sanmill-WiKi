# Development Process

## Roadmap

The team has a 6-12 months high level [[Roadmap]] which defines high level themes and features to be addressed in this time frame.

## Iterations

We will work in quarterly iteration on the items on the [[roadmap]]. Iterations are roughly quarter, rather than month based. We will begin a milestone on the first day of every month and end on the last day of every month, meaning that each milestone can have a different duration, depending on how the months align.

At the end of each iteration, we want to have a version of Sanmill that can be used by the Sanmill community. The work planned during an iteration is captured in the iteration plan (see [[Iteration Plans]]). The feature highlights of each iteration are highlighted in the release notes.

### Definition of Done

- [ ] Screen reader accessible
- [ ] Release notes updated

## Triage

Bugs and features will be assigned a milestone, and within a milestone, they will be assigned a priority. The priority dictates the order in which issues should be addressed. An `important` bug (something that we think is critical for the milestone) is to be addressed before the other bugs.

To find out when a bug fix will be available in an update, then please check the milestone that is assigned to the issue.

Please see [[Issue Tracking]] for a description of the different workflows we are using.

## Monthly

Each month we will manage work items, crossing off completed features, and triaging bugs. At the end of the milestone, we will strive for 0 bugs and 0 issues assigned to the milestone. Some bugs and features will then be either postponed to later milestones or moved back to the backlog.
