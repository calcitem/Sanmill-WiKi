# Insider Release Notes

Insiders builds are the builds we use internally to develop Sanmill.

Over the course of an iteration the contents of the Insiders builds will change frequently. Therefore, we do not produce a formal set of Release Notes. Instead, the following queries will help you explore the contents of a nightly build:

* [Commit log](https://github.com/Calcitem/Sanmill/commits/dev)

* [Recently closed issues](https://github.com/Calcitem/Sanmill/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

* [Current Release Notes on GitHub](https://github.com/calcitem/Sanmill/releases)
