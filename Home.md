## About Sanmill

Sanmill is a strong free Mill Game program.

Rules:

- A player who aligns three of his pieces on a board line has a mill and may remove his opponent's piece(s).
- Any player reduces to two pieces and has no option to form new mills and thus loses the game.
- A player can also lose with more than three pieces if his opponent blocks them not to be moved.

Features:

- Free, but much stronger than most Mill Apps without a database
- Support many rule variants
- Play against the AI, or play both sides
- Adjustable playing strength
- Highly configurable
- Color themes

## Statement

Sanmill is an open-source project, sharing and freely distributing the code, tools, and data needed to deliver this mill game engine. We do this because we are convinced that open software and open data are key ingredients to make rapid progress and thus benefit our users.

Selling Sanmill derivatives is possible with the GPLv3 license we grant, but not without requirements. In particular, the license states that if one redistributes a program derived from our work, the corresponding modifications of our sources and all information needed to build that program must be made available.
