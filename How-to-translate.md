How to translate the UI into a different language?

The following is an example of the way of translating English text into German:

Download https://raw.githubusercontent.com/calcitem/Sanmill/master/src/ui/flutter_app/lib/l10n/intl_en.arb

File intl_en.arb describes the role of each text field and the content of the English text. A small number of strings are strings that are not used by the App, and may be used after future feature upgrades.

Download sample: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/calcitem/Sanmill/master/src/ui/flutter_app/lib/l10n/intl_zh.arb as reference.

Rename `intl_zh.arb` to `intl_de.arb.txt`, and then modify Chinese strings to German strings.

Open https://github.com/calcitem/Sanmill/discussions/new

`Select Category` -- select `Translation`.

Title: German Translation

Drag `intl_de.arb.txt` to the text field, and click `Start discussion`.

We will try our best to put the new translation into the App and release it within two days. If you urgently need to update the App as soon as possible, you can download it at [Github Actions](https://github.com/calcitem/Sanmill/actions). Because the signing key is different from Google Play Store and F-Droid, you need to uninstall the original App and reinstall it. Thank you for your understanding!

If we do not reply this discussion within three days, you can send us an email: calcitem@outlook.com to remind us.

Thank you for your work!
