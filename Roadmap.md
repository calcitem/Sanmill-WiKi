# The Sanmill Roadmap 2022

Our roadmap typically looks out 12-18 months and we establish topics we want to work on. We don't start with our roadmap on a blank sheet. We develop it based on what we heard from you in issues, in face-to-face discussions, Telegram, and Twitter.

When we execute on our roadmap, we keep learning and our assessment of some of the topics listed changes. As a result, we may add or drop topics as we go. After around 12 months we come together to develop the next roadmap.

We describe some initiatives as "investigations" or "explorations" which means our goal in the next few months is to better understand the problem and potential solutions before scheduling actual feature work. Once an investigation is done, we will update our plans, either deferring the initiative or committing to it.

As always, we listen to your feedback and adapt our plans if needed.

## Values

Before we go into the details, let's start with our values that guide the development of Sanmill. They have pretty much remained the same since the early days and we don't have any intention to change them:

- Out of the box, Sanmill is a mill game app: lightweight and fast.
- Simple, uniform UI and UI interactions.
- Allow for CLI / UI co-existence and interplay whenever possible.
- Although we limit the default UI choices authors can make, authors can write powerful themes such as one that turn Sanmill into an app with bells and whistles.

## Themes for 2022

For 2022, we'll particularly focus in the following themes.

- Continue on our journey to be the best mill game app for anyone
- Update the infrastructure of our app; start the process of visual updates

## Summary

These are examples of some of the work we will be focusing on in the next 12-18 months. We continuously tune the plan based on feedback and we will provide more detail in each of our [Quarterly iteration plans](https://github.com/Calcitem/Sanmill/wiki/Iteration-Plans). We will develop our next roadmap in around 12 months from now. Please follow along and let us know what you think!
