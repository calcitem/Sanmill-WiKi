# Statement

Sanmill is an open-source project, sharing and freely distributing the code, tools, and data needed to deliver this mill game engine. We do this because we are convinced that open software and open data are key ingredients to make rapid progress and thus benefit our users. 

Selling Sanmill derivatives is possible with the GPLv3 license we grant, but not without requirements. In particular, the license states that if one redistributes a program derived from our work, the corresponding modifications of our sources and all information needed to build that program must be made available.
