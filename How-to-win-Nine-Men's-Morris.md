# Placing strategy

The first piece is always placed in the cross entrance, with four openings up and down, left and right, three openings in the T-shaped entrance, and only two openings in the corner, which is also the weakest inside.

AI's action: always place at your opposite cross entrance, the second piece place at another cross entrance, AI's action will think you want to make a triangle and block.

If you are Player two, the AI's action is to try to make a triangle.

Please don't block AI from making a triangle here. If AI loses one son after making a triangle, it can limit the opponent's four pieces. Then it can make 1-3 fortresses in four directions or the middle. Its purpose is to block the opponent from closing a Mill and then punish the opponent for giving up. Otherwise, don't tear down the defense line. Support 3-4 fortresses: try to close a Mill during the movement. Check 1-2: the purpose is to force the opponent's piece to become a fortress. If he moves, you can close a Mill.

PS: the two roles of Fortress root support cannot overlap!

# Moving strategy

1. Don't move the fort unless the opponent withdraws.
2. Move the corner to the middle.
3. The supporting piece block may interfere with your piece block first.
4. Then, the supporting piece units have closed a Mill.

# Removing strategy

1. Give priority to remove pieces that are trying to close a Mill.
2. Eat each other's fortress.
3. The third party comes to block the Mill you are completing.
4. Finally, remove all the pieces except the corner.

When you have less than 8, it's hazardous to let the opponent run around, and then you will become 3. If you play with real people, the end is a draw. So try to surround the remaining 4 enemies.

# 下棋策略

第一颗子永远摆在十字入口，有上下左右4个开口，T字入口有3个开口，而角落只有2个开口也是里面最弱的

AI的动作：永远下载你的对面十字入口，第二颗子再占下另一个十字入口，AI的动作会以为你要做成三角而阻挡

如果你是后下的，AI的动作就是会试图做成三角。

在这里请注意别阻挡AI做成三角，如果AI做成三角后损失一子，但是可以限制对方4个子的空间，之后在4个方位或中间分别做成，堡垒1~3个：它的目的就是阻挡对方连成3颗子，之后处分对方放弃否则别拆掉防线，支援3-4个：试图在移动过程中连成3颗子，牵制1-2个：目的是让对方的子强制变成堡垒，如果他移动的话你就可以连成3颗子。


PS：堡垒根支援这2个角色不能重叠!

# 移动策略

1、别移动堡垒除非对方撤出。

2、让角落的子移到中间。

3、支援的子先挡住可能干扰你的子。

4、接着支援的子做成一线。


# 吃棋策略

1、优先吃掉对方试图连线的子。

2、次要吃掉对方的堡垒。

3、第三吃掉对方赶来阻挡你正完成的连线。

4、最后吃掉除了角落外的子。

当你少于8颗时让对方到处跑是很危险的，之后你也会变成3颗，如果跟真人玩的话下场就是和局不过ASC3的AI会有赢的机会，所以尽量围住敌人剩下的4颗子。
