The translation involves some professional terms related to the Mill Game, which makes machine translation difficult. 

This is a FREE App. We do not rely on advertising or in-app purchases and do not have any income. Therefore, we hope that volunteers can help us with translation and grammar checking. Your efforts will help our App do better and benefit more people around the world. We sincerely thank you!
