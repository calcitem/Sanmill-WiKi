# Translation and Localization

The Mill app is available in many languages. Is the Mill app not in your language, or is the translation incorrect or incomplete? Please get involved in the translations on our [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/sanmill/) to make your changes.

To keep the workflow easy, all translation work is done in [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/sanmill/).

## Adding a new language

First and foremost, Android must already support the specific language and locale you want to add. We cannot work with languages that Android and the SDK do not support. The tools break down. Next, if you consider adding a country-specific language (e.g., de-AT), first make sure that the primary language is well maintained (e.g., de). Your contribution might be helpful to more people if you contribute to the existing version of your language rather than the country-specific variant.

Anyone can create a new language via [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/sanmill/).

## Android app

As a general rule, a translation must be at least 70% complete to be included in a final release. We try to contain all translations for alpha releases, no matter how incomplete.
