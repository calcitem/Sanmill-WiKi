# Translation and Localization

The Mill app is available in many languages. Is the Mill app not in your language or the translation is incorrect or incomplete? Get involved in the translations on our [POEditor](https://poeditor.com/join/project?hash=DStQiKAsPb) to make your changes.

All translation work is done in POEditor to keep the workflow easy.

## Adding a new language

First and foremost, Android must already support the specific language and locale you want to add. We cannot work with languages that Android and the SDK do not support, the tools simply break down. Next, if you are considering adding a country-specific variant of a language (e.g. de-AT), first make sure that the main language is well maintained (e.g. de). Your contribution might be useful to more people if you contribute to the existing version of your language rather than the country-specific variant.

Anyone can create a new language via POEditor.

## Android app

As a general rule, a translation must be at least 70% complete for it to be included in a final release. For alpha releases, we try to include all translations, no matter how incomplete.
