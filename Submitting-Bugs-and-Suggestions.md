# Submitting Bugs and Suggestions

The Sanmill project tracks issues and feature requests using the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/Calcitem/Sanmill/issues) for the `Sanmill` repository.

### Before Submitting an Issue

Do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/Calcitem/Sanmill/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed. Use this [query](https://github.com/calcitem/Sanmill/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aenhancement) to search for the most popular feature requests.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction on the issue description rather than adding a "+1" comment.

👍 - up vote

👎 - down vote

If your issue is a question then please ask the question on [Discussions](https://github.com/calcitem/Sanmill/discussions).

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, submit an issue using the guidelines below.

## Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem or feature request.

* Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.
* Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

Please include the following with each issue.

* Version of Sanmill
* Platform it is running on.
* Reproducible steps (1... 2... 3...) and what you expected versus what you actually saw.
* Images, animations, or a video. These can usually be pasted directly into the description field on GitHub. Note that images and animations illustrate repro-steps but *do not* replace them.
* A code snippet that demonstrates the issue, or a link to a code repository we can easily pull down onto our machine to recreate the issue.

> **Note:** Because we need to copy and paste the code snippet, including a code snippet as a media file (e.g. .gif) is not sufficient.

* Errors displayed in the Dev Tools Console.

Please remember to do the following:

* Search the issue repository first to see if a duplicate exists.
* Simplify your code around the issue so we can better isolate the problem.

Don't feel bad if we can't reproduce the issue and ask for more information!

Finally, this is our [issue tracking](https://github.com/Calcitem/Sanmill/wiki/Issue-Tracking) work flow that describes what happens once you submitted an issue.
