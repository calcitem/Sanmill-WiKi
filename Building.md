# Building

See [How to Build](https://github.com/calcitem/Sanmill/blob/dev/README.md#how-to-build).

## Continuous Integration

How do the CI builds run?

All our builds run in GitHub Actions and are scripted using YAML build definition files:

- [dev](https://github.com/Calcitem/Sanmill/tree/dev/.github/workflows)
- [master](https://github.com/Calcitem/Sanmill/tree/master/.github/workflows)
